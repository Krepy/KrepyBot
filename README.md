# KrepyBot

This is a bot i code to learn coding. Help is appreciated.


<p>You need to create a 'config.json' file in bot's main directory containing:<br />
`{"token": "[Your Token Here]", "prefix": "[Prefix Here]"}`</p>

<p>You'll be needing following libraries:<br />
    •discord.py v1<br />
    •lxml<br />
    •requests<br />
    •sqlite3</p>
