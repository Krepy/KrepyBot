# KrepyBot

This is a bot i code to learn how to do things and this is my first project on Github. So i hope to get help with setting things up and running.


<p>You need to create a 'config.json' file in bot's main directory containing:<br />
`{"token": "[Your Token Here]", "prefix": "[Prefix Here]"}`</p>

<p>You'll be needing following libraries:<br />
    •discord.py v1<br />
    •lxml<br />
    •requests<br />
    •sqlite3</p>
