# KrepyBot

This is a bot i code to learn how to do things and this is my first project on Github. So i hope to get help with setting things up and running.


You need to create a 'config.json' file in bot's main directory containing:\n
`{"token": "[Your Token Here]", "prefix": "[Prefix Here]"}`

You'll be needing following libraries:\n
    discord.py v1\n
    lxml\n
    requests\n
    sqlite3
